# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for high-traffic applications, focusing on performance and reliability.
# It includes settings to minimize engine substitutions, disable slow query logging for efficiency,
# and limit connections to prevent overload, while incorporating additional parameters for a robust setup.

# slow_query_log disabled to reduce overhead in high-traffic environments
max_connections = 100
# max_connections limited to 100 to optimize resource usage and prevent server overload in high-traffic scenarios

# Additional performance tuning for high-traffic applications
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 128M
# Sets the buffer pool size for InnoDB to cache frequently accessed data, improving read performance
innodb_log_file_size = 48M
# Larger log file size for better write performance and durability
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 1
# Ensures full ACID compliance by flushing logs on transaction commit, balancing performance and reliability
query_cache_type = 1
# Enables query cache to speed up repeated queries, suitable for read-heavy high-traffic apps
query_cache_size = 16M
# Allocates memory for query caching to handle frequent queries efficiently
thread_cache_size = 10
# Maintains a cache of threads to reduce overhead for new connections
table_open_cache = 200
# Increases the cache for open tables to handle more concurrent queries
tmp_table_size = 32M
# Sets the maximum size for in-memory temporary tables, preventing disk spills
max_heap_table_size = 32M
# Limits the size of memory-based tables for better memory management
skip-name-resolve
# Disables DNS lookups for faster connection handling
log-error = /var/log/mysql/error.log
# Specifies the error log file for monitoring and debugging
character-set-server = utf8mb4
# Sets the default character set for the server to support a wide range of languages
