# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for high-traffic applications, focusing on performance and reliability.
# It includes settings to enforce strict SQL modes, log errors for troubleshooting, and use MyISAM as the default storage engine.
# Additional parameters are included to handle concurrency, memory usage, and security in a real-world environment.
