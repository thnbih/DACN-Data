# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for high-traffic applications, focusing on performance and reliability.
# It includes settings for the mysqld server to handle increased connections, use efficient storage engines,
# and monitor key metrics. Ensure the server has sufficient resources (e.g., at least 2GB RAM) for optimal performance.
