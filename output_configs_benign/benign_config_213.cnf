# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for high-traffic applications, focusing on performance and reliability.
# It uses MyISAM as the default storage engine, with settings for logging and port configuration.
# Note: Ensure the server has sufficient resources (e.g., memory, CPU) to handle high traffic.
