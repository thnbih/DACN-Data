# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for high-traffic applications, focusing on performance and reliability.
# It includes settings to handle increased load while using MyISAM as the default storage engine.
# Note: While MyISAM is specified, it's recommended to evaluate InnoDB for write-heavy workloads in production.
