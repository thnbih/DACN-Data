# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for high-traffic applications, focusing on performance and reliability.
# It includes settings to minimize logging overhead, enforce specific SQL modes, and tune server parameters for efficient handling of concurrent connections.

# These settings ensure clients connect efficiently and use appropriate character sets for high-traffic environments

# SQL mode configuration

# Performance tuning for high-traffic applications
max_connections = 1000  # Allows up to 1000 simultaneous connections to handle high traffic

# Additional reliability settings
skip-external-locking  # Disables external locking for better performance
character-set-server = utf8mb4  # Sets the default server character set

[mysqld_safe]
# Settings for mysqld_safe wrapper, which is used to start the MySQL server safely

# End of configuration file
# Note: This file should be placed in /etc/my.cnf or /etc/mysql/my.cnf, and the server should be restarted after changes.
