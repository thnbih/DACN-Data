# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is tailored for development and testing environments,
# focusing on performance optimization and reliability. It includes settings
# to manage logging, query performance, and character set handling.

[client]
# Default settings for MySQL client connections
port            = 3306
socket          = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
default-character-set = utf8mb4  # Ensures client uses UTF-8 for compatibility with server

[mysql]
# Settings specific to the mysql command-line tool
no-beep         # Disable beep on errors for a quieter development experience
prompt          = "\\u@\\h:\\d> "  # Custom prompt for easier debugging

[mysqld]
# Server settings for optimized performance and reliability
port            = 3306
bind-address    = 127.0.0.1  # Bind to localhost for security in development environments
datadir         = /var/lib/mysql  # Default data directory; ensure this path exists
socket          = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
pid-file        = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid  # PID file for process management

# Logging and error handling
log-error       = /tmp/mysql_error.log  # Specifies the error log file as per requirements
slow_query_log  = 0  # Disable slow query logging to reduce overhead in testing
log_queries_not_using_indexes = 0  # Do not log queries not using indexes, as slow query log is off
general_log     = 0  # Disable general query log to optimize performance
general_log_file = /var/log/mysql/general.log  # File for general log if enabled

# Character set and collation for data consistency
character-set-server = utf8mb4  # Use UTF-8 character set for full Unicode support
collation-server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci  # Default collation for proper sorting and comparison

# Performance tuning settings for development
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 128M  # Set buffer pool size; adjust based on available memory (e.g., 128MB for testing)
innodb_log_file_size = 48M  # Size of InnoDB log files for better write performance
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 1  # Ensure data durability; set to 1 for reliability in testing
max_connections = 100  # Limit connections to prevent overload in development
table_open_cache = 200  # Cache for open tables to improve query speed
query_cache_type = 1  # Enable query cache for frequently run queries in testing
query_cache_size = 16M  # Size of query cache; helps in development but can be tuned

# Additional reliability settings
sync_binlog = 1  # Synchronize binary log for data integrity
expire_logs_days = 7  # Automatically expire binary logs after 7 days to manage disk space
tmp_table_size = 32M  # Size for temporary tables to handle complex queries
max_heap_table_size = 32M  # Maximum size for memory-based tables

# Security and other defaults
skip-name-resolve  # Skip DNS resolution for faster connections
sql-mode = "STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION"  # Strict SQL mode for reliable development
default-storage-engine = InnoDB  # Use InnoDB as default for transactional support
