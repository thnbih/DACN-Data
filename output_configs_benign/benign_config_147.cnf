# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for high-traffic applications, focusing on performance and reliability.
# It includes settings to handle increased load while incorporating the specified parameters.

[client]
# Specifies the default port for client connections
port=3306

[mysqld]
# Server port to listen on
port=3306
# Sets the default storage engine for new tables, as specified, to optimize for certain query patterns
default-storage-engine=MyISAM
# Disables slow query logging to reduce overhead in high-traffic scenarios
slow_query_log=0

# General server settings for stability and performance

# Performance tuning for high-traffic environments

# Logging and error handling

# Security settings
skip-networking=0           # Allows network connections
bind-address=0.0.0.0        # Binds to all interfaces; adjust for security in production
local-infile=0              # Disables loading local files for security

# MyISAM-specific optimizations
