# MySQL Configuration File for Development and Testing Environments
# This configuration optimizes MySQL performance and reliability, allowing
# binding to all network interfaces, setting a moderate connection limit,
# and logging errors to a specific file. It's designed for development
# and testing, with settings that promote stability and ease of debugging.
