# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for high-traffic applications, focusing on performance and reliability.
# It includes settings for the client and server to handle increased load, with MyISAM as the default storage engine.
# Note: MyISAM is specified as per the description, though for high-traffic scenarios, InnoDB is often recommended for better concurrency and crash recovery.

[client]
# Settings for MySQL client programs

host            = localhost  # Default host for client connections
socket          = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock  # Path to the Unix socket file

[mysql]
# Settings specific to the mysql command-line tool
no-auto-rehash  # Disable automatic rehashing for faster startup
default-character-set = latin1  # Ensure client uses the specified character set

[mysqld]
# Server settings for optimized performance and reliability in high-traffic environments

default-storage-engine = MyISAM  # Use MyISAM as the default storage engine as specified
