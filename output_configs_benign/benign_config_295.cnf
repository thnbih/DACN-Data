# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for high-traffic applications, focusing on performance, reliability, and security.
# It includes settings for the MySQL server and specific configurations for mysqldump to handle backups efficiently.

# Client section for general client connections
[client]
port            = 3306  # Default port for client connections, but overridden where specified
socket          = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
default-character-set = utf8mb4  # Ensures consistent character set usage

# MySQL Server section with optimizations for high-traffic environments
[mysqld]
port            = 3307  # Set to the specified port for server operations
bind-address    = 0.0.0.0  # Bind to all interfaces for accessibility, suitable for high-traffic but ensure firewall protection
character-set-server = utf8mb4  # Use UTF-8 multibyte character set for broad language support and data integrity

# Performance optimizations for high-traffic applications
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 4G  # Allocate a large buffer pool for InnoDB to cache data and indexes, reducing disk I/O
innodb_log_file_size = 512M  # Larger log files for better write performance in high-transaction scenarios
max_connections = 500  # Increase to handle more simultaneous connections in high-traffic environments
thread_cache_size = 200  # Cache threads to reduce overhead in creating new threads for connections
query_cache_size = 64M  # Enable query caching to speed up repeated queries (note: deprecated in MySQL 8+, use other caching mechanisms if needed)
table_open_cache = 4000  # Higher cache for open tables to improve performance with many tables
tmp_table_size = 64M  # Limit in-memory temporary tables to prevent disk spills
max_heap_table_size = 64M  # Maximum size for in-memory tables
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 1  # Ensure full durability for reliability, though it may impact performance slightly
sync_binlog = 1  # Synchronize binary logs for data consistency in replication setups
skip-name-resolve  # Skip DNS lookups for faster connections
sql_mode = STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION  # Strict SQL mode for reliability

# Logging and monitoring for reliability
log_error = /var/log/mysql/error.log  # Centralized error logging
slow_query_log = 1  # Enable slow query log to identify performance bottlenecks
slow_query_log_file = /var/log/mysql/slow.log
long_query_time = 2  # Log queries taking longer than 2 seconds

# Security enhancements
skip-symbolic-links  # Prevent symbolic link attacks
secure-file-priv = /var/lib/mysql-files  # Restrict file operations for security

# mysqldump section for backup configurations
[mysqldump]
port = 3307  # Specify the port to connect to the MySQL server, as per the description
quick  # Dump tables one by one for large databases to avoid memory issues
max_allowed_packet = 64M  # Increase packet size for handling large dumps
single-transaction  # Use a consistent snapshot for InnoDB tables without locking
set-gtid-purged=OFF  # Handle GTID for replication-aware backups if needed
character-sets-dir = /usr/share/mysql/charsets  # Directory for character sets, ensuring compatibility with utf8mb4

# Additional sections for completeness

[mysql]  # MySQL command-line client settings
no-auto-rehash  # Speed up client startup
default-character-set = utf8mb4  # Match server character set

[isamchk]
key_buffer_size = 16M  # Buffer for ISAM index repairs, though less common now

[myisamchk]
key_buffer_size = 16M  # Buffer for MyISAM index repairs

[mysqld_safe]
log-error = /var/log/mysql/mysqld_safe.log  # Logging for mysqld_safe wrapper
pid-file = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid  # PID file for process management

# Ensure the configuration is tuned based on system resources; adjust values as per hardware specifications.
