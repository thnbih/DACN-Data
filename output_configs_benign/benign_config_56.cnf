# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for development and testing environments,
# focusing on performance and reliability. It includes settings to bind to
# localhost only, use InnoDB as the default storage engine, and operate on
# a non-standard port for isolation. Adjustments have been made to ensure
# efficient resource usage while enabling logging and monitoring features.
