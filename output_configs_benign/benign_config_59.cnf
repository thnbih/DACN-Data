# /etc/my.cnf or /etc/mysql/my.cnf - MySQL Server Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for high-traffic applications, focusing on performance, reliability, and proper error logging.
# It includes settings for character encoding, custom port, and error logging as specified.

[client]
# Client-side settings to ensure compatibility with server encoding
default-character-set=utf8mb4
port=3308  # Use the same port as the server for consistency
socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

[mysqld]
# Server-side settings for performance optimization and reliability
port=3308  # Custom port to avoid conflicts and optimize for specific network setups
character-set-server=utf8mb4  # Ensures the server uses UTF-8 encoding for broad character support, reducing encoding issues in high-traffic scenarios
collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci  # Paired with character-set-server for consistent sorting and comparison
log-error=/tmp/mysql_error.log  # Specifies the error log file for monitoring and debugging, essential for reliability in production

# General server settings
user=mysql  # Run the MySQL server as the mysql user for security
basedir=/usr  # Base directory for MySQL installation
datadir=/var/lib/mysql  # Data directory for database files
tmpdir=/tmp  # Temporary directory for operations like sorting
socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock  # Unix socket for local connections
pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid  # PID file for process management

# Performance tuning for high-traffic applications
max_connections=200  # Increased from default to handle more simultaneous connections
max_allowed_packet=64M  # Larger packet size for handling bigger queries or data transfers
wait_timeout=28800  # Extended timeout to accommodate long-running queries in high-load environments
interactive_timeout=28800  # Similar to wait_timeout for interactive sessions
thread_stack=256K  # Stack size per thread, adjusted for potential high concurrency
thread_cache_size=10  # Cache for threads to reduce overhead in frequent connections

# InnoDB settings for reliability and performance
default-storage-engine=INNODB  # Use InnoDB as the default for transactional support
innodb_buffer_pool_size=1G  # Significant buffer for caching data and indexes, optimized for high-traffic; adjust based on server RAM
innodb_log_buffer_size=16M  # Buffer for transaction logs to handle write-intensive workloads
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1  # Ensures data durability at the cost of some performance
innodb_file_per_table=1  # Each table in its own file for better management and backup

# Query and logging optimizations
query_cache_type=1  # Enable query caching to speed up repeated queries
query_cache_size=64M  # Size of the query cache; helps in high-traffic reads
query_cache_limit=2M  # Limit for individual query results in cache
slow_query_log=1  # Enable logging of slow queries for performance analysis
slow_query_log_file=/var/log/mysql/slow.log  # File for slow query logs
long_query_time=2  # Log queries taking longer than 2 seconds
log_queries_not_using_indexes=1  # Log queries not using indexes to identify optimization opportunities
general_log=0  # Disable general query log to avoid overhead in production
general_log_file=/var/log/mysql/general.log  # File for general logs if enabled

# Security and monitoring
bind-address=0.0.0.0  # Bind to all interfaces; restrict in production if needed
skip-name-resolve=1  # Skip DNS resolution for faster connections
secure-file-priv=/var/lib/mysql  # Restrict file operations for security
sql_mode=STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION  # Strict SQL mode for reliability

[mysqld_safe]
log-error=/tmp/mysql_error.log  # Mirror error log for mysqld_safe
pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid

!includedir /etc/my.cnf.d  # Include any additional configuration files from this directory
