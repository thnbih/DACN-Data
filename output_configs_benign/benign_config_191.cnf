# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for high-traffic applications, focusing on performance and reliability.
# It includes settings for character encoding, error logging, and storage engine selection.
# Note: Using MyISAM as the default storage engine may suit certain workloads but lacks transactional support;
#       consider InnoDB for more robust high-traffic scenarios if needed.

[client]
# General client settings for connections
default-character-set=latin1        # Set the default character set for client connections to match server settings
port=3306                           # Standard MySQL port
socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock  # Default Unix socket for local connections
host=localhost                      # Default host for client connections
protocol=tcp                        # Use TCP/IP protocol for connections

[mysql]
# Settings specific to the mysql command-line tool
no-beep                             # Disable beep on errors
