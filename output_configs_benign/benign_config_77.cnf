# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for high-traffic applications, focusing on performance and reliability.
# It includes settings to enforce strict SQL modes, allow binding to all network interfaces, and use MyISAM as the default storage engine.
# Additional parameters have been added to handle high loads, such as increased buffer sizes and connection limits.
