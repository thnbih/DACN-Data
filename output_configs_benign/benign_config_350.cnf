# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for development and testing environments,
# focusing on performance, reliability, and ease of management. It includes
# settings to limit resource usage, enable logging for debugging, and ensure
# data integrity. The file is structured to be compatible with MySQL Server.
