# MySQL Configuration File
# This file is used to configure MySQL server for optimal performance and reliability,
# particularly for high-traffic applications. It includes settings to handle increased
# connections, ensure data consistency, and improve query efficiency.

[client]
# Client-side settings to ensure compatibility with the server
default-character-set=utf8mb4   # Use UTF-8 for character encoding to support a wide range of languages
port=3306                       # Standard MySQL port
host=localhost                  # Default host for client connections
socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock  # Path to the MySQL socket for local connections

[mysqld]
# Server-side settings optimized for high-traffic environments
user=mysql                      # User under which MySQL runs for security
port=3306                       # Server port to match client
basedir=/usr                    # Base directory for MySQL installation
datadir=/var/lib/mysql          # Directory for data storage
tmpdir=/tmp                     # Temporary directory for operations
socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock  # Socket path for server
pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid  # PID file location

# Specified settings as per description
character-set-server=utf8mb4    # Set the default character set for the server to support Unicode
default-storage-engine=InnoDB   # Use InnoDB as the default engine for transactional reliability
max_connections=500             # Allow up to 500 simultaneous connections to handle high traffic

# Performance optimizations for high-traffic applications
innodb_buffer_pool_size=4G      # Size of the buffer pool for InnoDB, tuned for systems with at least 8GB RAM
innodb_log_file_size=256M       # Size of InnoDB log files to improve write performance
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1  # Ensure full ACID compliance, though it may impact performance slightly

thread_cache_size=100           # Cache threads to reduce overhead for new connections
table_open_cache=2000           # Cache frequently used tables to speed up access
query_cache_type=1              # Enable query cache (if supported in the MySQL version)
query_cache_size=64M            # Size of the query cache to store results of frequent queries
tmp_table_size=64M              # Maximum size for in-memory temporary tables
max_heap_table_size=64M         # Maximum size for memory-based tables
sort_buffer_size=2M             # Buffer size for sorting operations
join_buffer_size=2M             # Buffer size for join operations
read_buffer_size=1M             # Buffer size for reading sequential data
read_rnd_buffer_size=1M         # Buffer size for reading random data

# Reliability and logging settings
slow_query_log=1                # Enable logging of slow queries for analysis
slow_query_log_file=/var/log/mysql/slow.log  # Path to the slow query log file
long_query_time=2               # Log queries that take longer than 2 seconds
log_error=/var/log/mysql/error.log  # Path to the error log file

max_allowed_packet=64M          # Maximum size of a packet for queries, to handle larger data transfers
sql_mode=STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION  # Strict SQL mode for data integrity

# Additional server settings
skip-name-resolve               # Skip DNS lookups for faster connections
bind-address=0.0.0.0            # Bind to all interfaces, but consider restricting in production for security
lower_case_table_names=1        # Make table names case-insensitive for consistency
wait_timeout=28800              # Time in seconds to wait for activity on a connection before closing
interactive_timeout=28800       # Similar for interactive sessions

[mysqld_safe]
log-error=/var/log/mysql/mysqld_safe.log  # Log file for mysqld_safe
pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid       # PID file for mysqld_safe

[mysql]
no-auto-rehash                   # Speed up command-line client startup
