# MySQL Server Configuration for High-Traffic Applications
# This configuration optimizes performance and reliability, suitable for environments with significant load.
# It includes settings for error logging, character sets, and InnoDB tuning as specified.

user=mysql                # User under which MySQL runs for security and isolation
basedir=/usr/local/mysql  # Base directory for MySQL installation
datadir=/var/lib/mysql    # Directory for data storage; ensure this path exists and is writable
tmpdir=/tmp               # Temporary directory for operations like sorting and temporary tables
socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock  # Unix socket file for local connections
port=3306                 # Standard port for MySQL server; can be changed for security

# Logging and Error Handling
log-error=/tmp/mysql_error.log  # Specified path for error logging to centralize and monitor issues
log-output=FILE               # Output logs to file for better management in high-traffic scenarios
slow-query-log=1              # Enable slow query logging to identify performance bottlenecks
slow-query-log-file=/var/log/mysql/slow_queries.log  # File for slow query logs
long-query-time=2             # Log queries taking longer than 2 seconds

# Character Set and Collation Settings
character-set-server=latin1  # Specified character set for server-wide encoding; note this is legacy, consider utf8mb4 for modern use
collation-server=latin1_swedish_ci  # Default collation matching the character set
character-set-client-handshake=FALSE  # Force clients to use the server character set

# InnoDB Storage Engine Optimizations
innodb_buffer_pool_size=2G    # Specified buffer pool size to cache data and indexes, improving read/write performance
innodb_log_file_size=1G       # Size of InnoDB log files for better transaction throughput and recovery
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1  # Ensure data durability by flushing logs on commit, critical for reliability
innodb_file_per_table=1       # Store each table in its own file for easier management and backup
innodb_buffer_pool_instances=4  # Multiple instances for better concurrency in high-traffic environments
innodb_read_io_threads=8     # Increase I/O threads for handling more concurrent reads
innodb_write_io_threads=8    # Increase I/O threads for handling more concurrent writes

# General Performance Tuning
max_connections=1000         # Allow up to 1000 simultaneous connections to handle high traffic
table_open_cache=2000        # Cache for open tables to reduce overhead on frequent accesses
thread_cache_size=100        # Cache idle threads to speed up new connections
query_cache_type=0           # Disable query cache as it's deprecated in newer MySQL versions; use other caching mechanisms
tmp_table_size=32M           # Maximum size for internal in-memory temporary tables
max_heap_table_size=32M      # Maximum size for memory-based tables to avoid disk spills
join_buffer_size=4M          # Buffer for joins to optimize query performance
sort_buffer_size=4M          # Buffer for sorting operations

# Security and Other Settings
bind-address=127.0.0.1      # Bind to localhost for security; change to 0.0.0.0 if remote access is needed
skip-name-resolve           # Skip DNS lookups for faster connections
sql_mode=STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION  # Enforce strict SQL mode for data integrity
default_storage_engine=InnoDB  # Default to InnoDB for transactional support in high-traffic apps
max_allowed_packet=64M      # Increase packet size for large queries or data transfers

# Monitoring and Maintenance
innodb_monitor_enable=all   # Enable InnoDB monitors for performance insights
expire_logs_days=7          # Automatically expire binary logs after 7 days to manage disk space
