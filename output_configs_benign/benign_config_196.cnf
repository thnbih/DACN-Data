# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is tailored for development and testing environments,
# focusing on optimizing performance and reliability. It includes settings
# to bind to all network interfaces, use a custom port, and disable slow
# query logging to reduce overhead. Ensure the data directory and other
# paths are adjusted based on your system setup.
