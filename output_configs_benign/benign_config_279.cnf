# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for high-traffic applications, focusing on performance and reliability.
# It includes settings to manage error logging, disable slow query logging for reduced overhead, and enforce a specific SQL mode.
# Adjustments have been made to buffer sizes, connection limits, and other parameters to handle increased load effectively.
