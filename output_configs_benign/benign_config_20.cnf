# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for development and testing environments,
# focusing on performance and reliability. It includes settings to handle
# a moderate number of connections, bind to all network interfaces, and
# allocate sufficient memory for InnoDB operations. Ensure the file is placed
# in the appropriate directory, such as /etc/my.cnf or /etc/mysql/my.cnf,
# and that the MySQL service is restarted after changes.
