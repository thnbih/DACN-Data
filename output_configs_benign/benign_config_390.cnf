# This configuration is optimized for development and testing environments,
# focusing on performance and reliability. It includes settings to bind to
# localhost, use MyISAM as the default storage engine, and log errors to a
# specified file. Additional parameters are included to ensure a complete,
# realistic setup suitable for real-world use.
