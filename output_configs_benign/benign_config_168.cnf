# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for development and testing environments,
# focusing on performance, reliability, and security. It includes settings
# to bind the server to localhost, enforce specific SQL modes, and log errors
# for easier debugging. Ensure the file is placed in /etc/my.cnf or ~/.my.cnf
# as appropriate, and adjust paths based on your system setup.
