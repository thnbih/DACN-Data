# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for high-traffic applications, focusing on performance, reliability, and logging.
# It includes settings to enable slow query logging, enforce strict SQL modes, and use InnoDB as the default storage engine.
# Adjustments should be made based on server hardware and specific workload requirements.
