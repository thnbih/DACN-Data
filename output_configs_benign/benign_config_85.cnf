# MySQL Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for high-traffic applications, focusing on performance and reliability.
# It includes settings to bind to localhost, use InnoDB as the default storage engine, and enforce strict SQL modes.
# Additional parameters are included to handle concurrency, memory management, and logging effectively.
